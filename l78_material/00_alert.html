        <p>This is an example that shows an alert window once the page is loaded (or rather: once the script tag at the bottom of the body is parsed).</p>

        <script>
            //Once this statement is reached, a popup notification (an "alert" in JavaScript) is loaded.
            window.alert("Script loaded");
